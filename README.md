+++++ Notes to track +++++

In this code, the user is prompted to enter a domain, which is then passed as an argument to the enumerate_subdomains_and_paths function. This function then enumerates all possible combinations of subdomains and paths for the given domain.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

> > > Enter a domain: www.example.com
> www.example.com/
> example.com/
> com/
